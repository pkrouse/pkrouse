I'm a VR software engineer, specializing in the Unity platform, and currently learning the Fusion framework.<br><br>
My repos include:<br><br>
[Electricity](https://github.com/pkrouse/Electricity)<br>
<img src="images/Lightning1.png" width="100" height="100" border="10"/> <img src="images/Lightning2.png" width="100" height="100" border="10"/> <img src="images/JacobsLadder.gif" width="100" height="100" border="10"/>

Three electrical effects - Lightning, Jacob's Ladder, and a single arc.  These are all scripted with some vector math and line renderers.<br>
This one can be run in VR or directly in Unity, but you will want the full VR experience for this.<br>
A complete explanation of this project is on Medium in three parts:<br>

I wrote a Candy Crush game strictly in C# for an assessment once, and decided to do it in VR. You have a brick wall, teleport tool, and a ray gun.<br>
Shoot out all the bricks to pass through.<br><br>
[Zombie on a Bicycle](https://github.com/pkrouse/ZombieOnABicycle)<br>
<img src="images/ZOAB.gif" width="100" height="100" border="10"/><br>
Fun with Mixamo animations and IK with Unity's Animation Rigging package.<br>

[Wall Switch in VR](https://github.com/pkrouse/WallSwitchInVR)<br>
I was experimenting with how to make a wall switch in VR.  Not my best work, but interesting IMO.<br>
Read the article first at [Implementing a wall switch in VR](https://medium.com/@pierce.krouse/implementing-a-wall-switch-in-vr-869b64885e49)<br><br>
[Geodesic Dome Experiments](https://github.com/pkrouse/DomeExperiments)<br>
Some geodesic domes I built in Blender and imported into VR.<br>
