I'm a VR software engineer, specializing in the Unity platform, and currently learning the Fusion framework.
My repos include:

[Electricity](https://github.com/pkrouse/Electricity)<br>
Three electrical effects - Lightning, Jacob's Ladder, and single arc.  These are all scripted with some vector math and line renderers.<br>
This one can be run in VR or directly in Unity, but you will want the full VR experience for this.<br>
[Candy Crush Portal](https://github.com/pkrouse/CandyCrushPortal)<br>
I wrote a Candy Crush game strictly in C# for an assessment once, and decided to do it in VR. You have a brick wall, teleport tool, and a ray gun.<br>
Shoot out all the bricks to pass through.<br>
